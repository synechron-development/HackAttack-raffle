Static Frontend Boilerplate
====

A minimal frontend boilerplate mainly emphasising workflow.

## About

This frontend boilerplate aims to exist in the background, not the spotlight.

All the magic happens in the [`gulpfile`](https://github.com/synechron-development/html-css-template/blob/master/gulpfile.js). The actual HTML/CSS/JS [code](https://github.com/synechron-development/html-css-template/tree/master/src) provides some useful but minimal boilerplate.

## Included

- Bootstrap (CDN)
- jQuery (CDN)

## Getting Started

In your terminal:

```shell
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

In your browser:

```shell
http://localhost:3000/
```

Work in the `src` folder, deploy from the `dist` folder.
